## BOILERPLATE FOR MONGODB WITH MONGOOSE

This small project can be used as a boilerplate for connecting your express app with MongoDB via mongoose. 

**Why mongoose is great:** 
- It comes with a set of handy methods
- It helps you to connect to MongoDB quick & easy
- It provides a schema-based solution to add data consistency to your not-so-consistent MongoDB-database
